If you want to add my debian repository you simply need to add my config and key to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/

You need to download the setup_apt_secure.sh.tar.gz tarball, extract it and run straight from
where you extracted it to:

./setup_apt_secure.sh

You will now have the https://01micko.github.io/debian repository available from 'apt'

The script is designed by Osamu Aoki - see https://osamuaoki.github.io/en/2022/08/20/deb-repo-1

You can then delete the script, it is no longer needed.
